INT. FOREST - DAY

Enter DUSHYANTA, Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, driving a sleek electric vehicle, pursuing a fleeing deer. MATHAVYA, his junior associate, navigates through the legal documents in the backseat.

MATHAVYA
(looking up from the documents)
Great Associate, this deer seems to be evading your pursuit. It’s almost as if it has a better understanding of the terrain than we do.

DUSHYANTA
(concentrated)
Mathavya, this agile creature has led us far from our legal team. Look, it bounds ahead! 

MATHAVYA
(sarcastically)
And what a sight it is. A creature evading capture, much like a case escaping the jurisdiction of the court.

DUSHYANTA
(eyes focused)
Indeed. Its graceful movements may be its defense strategy, while our speed is hindered by the uneven landscape. 

MATHAVYA
(raising an eyebrow)
Should we not adjust our approach? A swift analysis might bring us closer to the target.

DUSHYANTA
(nods)
You’re right. We need to recalibrate. Let's accelerate and keep the focus sharp.

MATHAVYA
(leans forward)
Accelerating now. The vehicle responds well, mimicking the deer’s evasive maneuvers.

DUSHYANTA
(grinning)
It’s as if our pursuit brings clarity to the case. Every moment we close the distance, the deer’s evasion becomes more apparent.

MATHAVYA
(slightly amused)
And yet, it remains elusive. Like a case that requires more than just speed—it needs strategy.

DUSHYANTA
(earnestly)
Then let’s devise a plan as we pursue. 

The vehicle speeds up, tires gripping the ground as they chase the deer deeper into the forest.

FADE OUT.

Scene: Meeting/watering plants
```plaintext
INT. FOREST ARCHIVE - DAY

Shakuntala, a woman with a strong presence, tends to a small garden of plants. She wears simple attire, a reflection of her life in the forest archive. Mathavya, her junior associate, stands nearby, logging details in his notebook.

SHAKUNTALA
(to Mathavya)
This way, we need to ensure the plants are properly hydrated.

MATHAVYA
(rolling his eyes)
I can't believe you were assigned this task. Who knew that Kanva had a preference for plants over people?

SHAKUNTALA
(smiling)
My duties here are a privilege, not a burden. These plants have become my companions.

DUSHYANTA (30s), Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, enters the scene, observing Shakuntala from a distance. He is composed yet intrigued.

DUSHYANTA
(to himself)
Is this Kanva’s ward? It seems odd for someone of her grace to be lost among these trees and plants.

He steps closer, hiding behind a nearby tree to watch her without drawing attention.

SHAKUNTALA
(to Mathavya)
Could you help me with this? The fabric is a bit tight. 

MATHAVYA
(reluctantly)
Fine. Just don't blame me if it doesn't fit well. 

SHAKUNTALA
(teasingly)
Blame my own growth, not the attire. 

DUSHYANTA
(under his breath)
Her spirit shines through even the simplest of garments. 

He watches her, captivated by her presence.

SHAKUNTALA
(looking around)
Something feels different today. 

DUSHYANTA
(stepping forward)
Perhaps it’s the company you keep, or the hope for change in your circumstances.

SHAKUNTALA
(turning to him)
And who might you be, lurking like a shadow?

DUSHYANTA
(smiling)
I’m Dushyanta, a Senior Associate. I’ve come to understand the legalities surrounding your... situation.

SHAKUNTALA
(standing tall)
Then perhaps you can help me prove who I am in this world, beyond the confines of this archive.

MATHAVYA
(understanding the gravity)
A legal identity is crucial. 

DUSHYANTA
(empathetic)
Let’s work together to establish your rights. 

SHAKUNTALA
(steadfast)
I won’t be a footnote in someone else’s case file. 

DUSHYANTA
(resolute)
Then let’s ensure you’re recognized for who you truly are.

They exchange a meaningful glance, the weight of their new partnership hanging in the air.

CUT TO BLACK.

Scene: Lineage reveal
```plaintext
INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A sleek, modern conference room filled with legal documents and a large screen displaying case files. DUSHYANTA sits at the head of the table, reviewing notes. SHAKUNTALA stands assertively, her demeanor strong despite her lack of official identification. Anasuya, a seasoned partner, observes quietly.

                                 DUSHYANTA
                   Shakuntala, your guardianship under Kanva 
                   presents challenges in establishing your identity. 
                   We need to explore the implications of your lineage.

                                 SHAKUNTALA
                   I understand the complexities, but my 
                   situation is straightforward. I deserve recognition. 
                   Kanva is a respected guardian; his word should hold weight.

                                 ANASUYA
                   Indeed, but without official documentation, 
                   proving lineage can become a significant hurdle. 
                   What can you provide to substantiate your claim?

                                 SHAKUNTALA
                   I can gather witness affidavits from those 
                   who know my history. I've lived it. 

                                 DUSHYANTA
                   That’s a step in the right direction. 
                   Witnesses can help establish a case for 
                   legal recognition of your status.

                                 SHAKUNTALA
                   I won’t be relegated to obscurity. 
                   My past matters, and I will not let it slip away.

                                 MATHAVYA (entering)
                   This is going to be complicated. 
                   Unregistered property claims are never simple, 
                   especially without a clear lineage.

                                 DUSHYANTA
                   Mathavya, focus on the potential. 
                   Shakuntala's determination can change the outcome.

                                 SHAKUNTALA
                   Exactly. I won’t accept anything less than justice. 
                   My identity is valid, and I will prove it.

                                 ANASUYA
                   Let’s compile a strategy. We will need 
                   to navigate the nuances of jurisdiction effectively.

                                 DUSHYANTA
                   Agreed. With the right approach, we can 
                   challenge the presumption of your non-existence.

                                 SHAKUNTALA
                   I appreciate your support. Let’s move forward 
                   and reclaim what’s rightfully mine.

The three exchange determined glances, a newfound resolve igniting the room.

                                                       FADE OUT.
```

Scene: Ring exchange - CRITICAL
```screenplay
INT. FOREST ARCHIVE - DAY

A serene forest archive, where nature intermingles with a makeshift legal setting. SHAKUNTALA stands in front of DUSHYANTA, who is poised and composed, holding a notary seal.

DUSHYANTA
(holding the seal)
This notary seal is more than a signature, Shakuntala. It symbolizes my commitment to recognizing your identity and future claims.

SHAKUNTALA
(takes a step closer)
What authority do you have in this forest? I have no official ID, no documentation.

DUSHYANTA
(empathically)
It doesn’t matter. This seal will serve as proof of your existence in the legal realm. You will be recognized.

SHAKUNTALA
(smirking)
And you expect nothing in return for this gift? 

DUSHYANTA
(earnestly)
I seek only to empower you. This seal is yours, to claim your rights when needed.

SHAKUNTALA
(accepting the seal)
A promise of recognition. I’ll hold you to it, Dushyanta.

DUSHYANTA
That’s my intent. 

They share a moment of mutual understanding as SHAKUNTALA holds the seal, a newfound sense of identity in her grasp.

FADE OUT.
```

Scene: Mathavya complains
```screenplay
INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS - OFFICE - DAY

MATHAVYA enters, visibly exasperated, clutching a stack of case files.

MATHAVYA  
(Sighing)  
Here we go again! I’m buried under paperwork while my senior associate gets lost in thought. Dushyanta, do you even remember we have clients waiting? 

DUSHYANTA  
(Absent-minded)  
Yes, Mathavya. I’m... aware of the workload.

MATHAVYA  
You’re aware? That’s a relief! I thought you were more interested in... I don’t know, daydreaming about a woman living in a forest? 

DUSHYANTA  
(Softly, distracted)  
She’s not just anyone. Shakuntala has the notary seal we need for our case file. 

MATHAVYA  
(Frowning)  
Right. And while she’s busy with her hermit life, we’re stuck here! I can't even take a coffee break without feeling guilty. 

DUSHYANTA  
(Still lost in thought)  
She understands the importance of the seal. 

MATHAVYA  
Sure, but what about our deadlines? I’m logging hours like they’re going out of style! 

DUSHYANTA  
(With a slight smile)  
Perhaps if you focus less on the burden and more on the task... 

MATHAVYA  
(Laughs dryly)  
Focus? With you pining for someone who lives off the grid? I’ll need a miracle to meet my billable hours!

DUSHYANTA  
(Shaking his head, still preoccupied)  
We’ll manage. We always do. 

MATHAVYA  
(Sarcastically)  
Yes, with a little help from our forest-dwelling friend. If only she’d register with the firm.

DUSHYANTA  
(Thoughtful)  
She has the seal. That’s recognition enough for now. 

MATHAVYA  
(Sighing dramatically)  
Recognition? Try telling that to the clients! They want results, not romantic distractions. 

DUSHYANTA  
(Focused)  
Let’s prioritize our cases. I’ll handle the... other matters later. 

MATHAVYA  
(Rolling his eyes)  
If "later" means never, then I’m in trouble. 

DUSHYANTA  
(Still distracted)  
We’ll figure it out. I’m counting on you, Mathavya. 

MATHAVYA  
(Smirking)  
And I’m counting on you to stop counting sheep! 

DUSHYANTA  
(With a small laugh)  
Fair enough. Let’s get to work.

They both turn back to their stacks of paperwork, the tension easing slightly.

FADE OUT.

Scene: Demon defense excuse
```plaintext
INT. FOREST ARCHIVE - DAY

A rustic office filled with legal books and documents. SHAKUNTALA sits at a makeshift desk, holding a notary seal. DUSHYANTA stands across from her, composed yet concerned. MATHAVYA paces, jotting notes.

MATHAVYA
(aside)
Demon defenses? Sounds like a legal nightmare.

DUSHYANTA
(to Shakuntala)
Your situation is urgent. The hermits require your presence to address the disturbances affecting their rituals.

SHAKUNTALA
(steadfast)
And I require recognition of my identity. My notary seal affirms my existence; it is not a tool for negotiation.

MATHAVYA
(dryly)
Most convenient. Nothing like a curse to complicate legal proceedings.

DUSHYANTA
(empathetic)
I understand your frustration. But we must balance duty to the hermits with your need for legal validation.

SHAKUNTALA
(assured)
Their request does not negate my rights. I will not return the seal; it is my proof.

MATHAVYA
(rolling eyes)
Sounds like a stalemate, but at least it’s not boring.

DUSHYANTA
(seriously)
We must find a way to honor both responsibilities. The hermits' call is pressing, yet your identity remains paramount.

SHAKUNTALA
(firm)
Then let us proceed with both. I will not let a technicality define me.

DUSHYANTA
(nodding)
Agreed. We shall advocate for your recognition while addressing the hermits’ concerns. 

MATHAVYA
(sarcastically)
A dual case. Just what I needed today.

DUSHYANTA
(with resolve)
Let’s prepare. We have a duty to fulfill.

They gather their materials, ready to face the challenges ahead.

FADE OUT.

Scene: Lovesickness
```screenplay
INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS OFFICE - DAY

DUSHYANTA stands alone in his office, surrounded by stacks of case files. His expression is one of deep contemplation.

DUSHYANTA  
(Sighs, looking at a photo of SHAKUNTALA)  
The legal system grants us rights, yet love eludes the bounds of jurisdiction. Shakuntala, you dwell in the forest archive, beyond the reach of my summons. You possess the notary seal—a symbol of our connection, a testament to your stake in my heart. 

He paces, his thoughts spiraling.  

DUSHYANTA  
(Voice thick with longing)  
Yet, how can this seal serve its purpose when I cannot reach you? This proof of our bond, now a reminder of your absence, weighs heavily on me. The law may bind us, but my heart yearns for your presence, your assertion of rights... 

He stops, staring out the window.

DUSHYANTA  
(Quietly)  
Why must love feel like litigation without resolution? 

MATHAVYA enters, clutching a clipboard, his demeanor dry and matter-of-fact.

MATHAVYA  
(Flatly)  
You appear to be in a state of emotional appeal, Senior Associate. Should I log this as a case of lovesickness? 

DUSHYANTA  
(Absently)  
It’s more than a case, Mathavya. It’s an unresolved claim, a longing for recognition that transcends mere documents. 

MATHAVYA  
(With a wry smile)  
A complex jurisdiction indeed. Should we draft a motion for her return?

DUSHYANTA  
(Shakes his head)  
No. It’s her choice to come forth. The seal remains with her; it signifies her intent. I can only wait and hope... 

MATHAVYA  
(Deadpan)  
Waiting, as always, is the hardest part of litigation. 

DUSHYANTA  
(Thoughtful)  
Perhaps. But in this case, it’s worth every moment. 

DUSHYANTA gazes at the photo once more, his heart heavy with unfulfilled desire.

FADE OUT.

Scene: Love letter writing

INT. FOREST ARCHIVE - DAY

SHAKUNTALA stands among the trees, reading a handwritten note. She wears a simple dress, lacking any formal identification. The sun filters through the leaves, casting a warm glow.

DUSHYANTA, a Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, approaches from behind a tree, watching her intently. He steps forward, revealing himself.

DUSHYANTA
(calmly)
You have the notary seal, Shakuntala. It can validate your status.

SHAKUNTALA
(turns, assertive)
This seal is not a bargaining chip, Dushyanta. It represents my identity, not just a document.

DUSHYANTA
(empathic)
I understand. But without a formal registration, how can you prove your guardianship under Kanva?

SHAKUNTALA
(witty)
Isn't it ironic? The very forest that shelters me holds my truth, yet lacks the legal framework to recognize it.

DUSHYANTA
(precise)
We can draft an affidavit. Your consent, coupled with the seal, can form a valid agreement.

SHAKUNTALA
(smirking)
A handwritten note might lack the formality, but our mutual agreement holds weight, doesn't it?

DUSHYANTA
(nods)
Indeed. It establishes precedent, regardless of registration.

SHAKUNTALA
(stepping closer)
Then let's ensure my identity is recognized. I won’t let the system dismiss me.

DUSHYANTA
(softly)
You deserve acknowledgment. Your story matters, and I will help you.

SHAKUNTALA
(firmly)
I will not relinquish my seal. It’s mine to wield.

DUSHYANTA
(resolutely)
Let’s use it wisely. Together, we can navigate this jurisdiction.

They share a moment of understanding, the weight of their situation settling between them.

FADE OUT.

INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS - PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

The office is modern, with large windows allowing sunlight to stream in. DUSHYANTA sits at his desk, reviewing a case file. He looks up as SHAKUNTALA enters, her presence commanding despite her informal attire.

SHAKUNTALA
(holding the notary seal)
This validates our agreement, doesn’t it? 

DUSHYANTA
(leaning forward)
Yes, it does. The seal confirms our mutual consent, establishing a common law marriage. 

SHAKUNTALA
(smiling)
And yet, it feels more substantial than mere paperwork. 

DUSHYANTA
(nodding)
I understand. The bureaucratic system often overlooks personal commitments. 

SHAKUNTALA
(steadfast)
I refuse to let that diminish our bond. This seal is ours, and I won’t return it. 

DUSHYANTA
(with empathy)
I’m not asking for it back. Our union is valid, regardless of formal registration. 

SHAKUNTALA
(firmly)
Exactly. We exist beyond the confines of legalities. 

DUSHYANTA
(sincerely)
Then let us move forward, recognized in our own right. 

SHAKUNTALA
(assured)
Together, we’ll navigate whatever comes next.

They share a moment of understanding, their commitment transcending the boundaries of law.

FADE OUT.

Scene: Separation
```plaintext
INT. OFFICE LOUNGE - EVENING

DUSHYANTA, a composed senior associate, stands near a coffee table, reviewing case files. SHAKUNTALA, assertive and clear, approaches him, frustration evident.

SHAKUNTALA  
Dushyanta, I’ve been navigating this system without an ID for too long. It’s unjust.

DUSHYANTA  
I understand, Shakuntala. The jurisdiction is strict, but we need your affidavit to proceed. 

SHAKUNTALA  
I’ve already provided the necessary details. This technicality is blocking my recognition. 

MATHAVYA, the junior associate, enters, writing in his notebook with a dry tone.

MATHAVYA  
Just to log this—another day lost due to bureaucratic hurdles. 

SHAKUNTALA  
(ignoring Mathavya)  
We have a case to build. I can’t be sidelined because of a lack of a notary seal. 

Suddenly, GAUTAMI bursts into the room, holding a file.

GAUTAMI  
(entering with urgency)  
Shakuntala! We need to discuss your legal status immediately. 

SHAKUNTALA  
(relieved but anxious)  
Finally, someone who understands the urgency. 

DUSHYANTA  
(supporting)  
This is crucial. We can’t let this technicality derail your case.

GAUTAMI  
(approaching Shakuntala)  
Your presence must be registered. We’ll resolve this together. 

SHAKUNTALA  
(grateful yet determined)  
Thank you, Gautami. I won’t let this curse of invisibility define me. 

MATHAVYA  
(sarcastically)  
Great, another meeting to log.

SHAKUNTALA  
(looking at Dushyanta)  
Time is of the essence. Let’s act swiftly.

DUSHYANTA  
(nods)  
Absolutely. Let’s gather the necessary documentation.

The tension shifts as they prepare to tackle the bureaucratic barriers ahead, but the weight of potential separation lingers.

FADE OUT.
