Scene: Hunt scene
**LEGAL DRAMA ADAPTATION**

**SETTING: A busy corporate office of Puru Law Partners, where a large, sleek conference room overlooks the city skyline. The atmosphere is charged with energy as the team prepares for a big case.**

---

**[Enter DUSHYANTA, a Senior Associate, dressed sharply in a tailored suit, holding a briefcase, flanked by MATHAVYA, a Junior Associate, who is typing furiously on his laptop.]**

**MATHAVYA.**  
[_Glancing at the documents on his screen and then at DUSHYANTA._]  
Great Associate, when I look at our case files, and then at you, whose arguments are like arrows aimed straight at the core of the matter, it feels as though I’m witnessing the might of the legal gods in action! 

**DUSHYANTA.**  
Mathavya, focus! We have a case to win. Look! The plaintiff's claims are slipping through our fingers like a fleeting antelope. 

**MATHAVYA.**  
[_Frantically clicking through the tabs on his laptop._]  
Aye, but this client’s documentation is a mess! Without proper identification or status, she’s like a deer lost in the woods of our legal system. 

**DUSHYANTA.**  
[_Determined, scanning the files._]  
We must not let her slip away. See! The evidence suggests she has a rightful claim to that property. If we can just get her properly registered, we stand a chance!

**MATHAVYA.**  
[_Nervously looking at the clock._]  
But we’re far from our resources! With our team scattered, we could be chasing shadows! 

**DUSHYANTA.**  
[_Resolute, as he tightens his grip on the briefcase._]  
Then we must press on! I will gather the team; we need to close in on the facts! 

**MATHAVYA.**  
[_With an exaggerated sigh, typing rapidly._]  
I can’t believe we’re doing this without official status. It’s like hunting for a deer in a field of legal loopholes! 

**DUSHYANTA.**  
[_Excitedly._]  
But look! The data is coming together! The inconsistencies in their claims are becoming clearer. We can outmaneuver them if we act fast! 

**MATHAVYA.**  
[_Eyes widening as he sees something on his screen._]  
Great Prince, see! The opposing counsel is scrambling! They’re unprepared for our next move! 

**DUSHYANTA.**  
[_Joyously._]  
In good sooth, if we can leverage this information, we may just outpace their arguments and secure our client’s rights!

**MATHAVYA.**  
[_Typing with renewed vigor._]  
Then let us chase this victory with all we have!

**[DUSHYANTA and MATHAVYA exit the conference room with determination, ready to confront the challenges that lie ahead in their pursuit of justice.]**

Scene: Meeting/watering plants
**INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS OFFICE - OFFICE GARDEN - DAY**

*The office garden is lush and serene, with plants in need of care. SHAKUNTALA, dressed in simple yet elegant attire that reflects her unconventional background, is tending to the plants. MATHAVYA, a junior associate, stands nearby with a clipboard, grumbling about the workload. DUSHYANTA, a senior associate, enters and notices SHAKUNTALA.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(cheerfully, to MATHAVYA)*  
This way, my dear companion; let’s ensure the plants are well-watered.

**MATHAVYA**  
*(sighing)*  
Honestly, Shakuntala, I’d think that Mr. Kanva must have more affection for these plants than for you. Assigning you, whose grace rivals the finest intern, to this task?

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(smiling softly)*  
Dear Mathavya, while I understand your concerns, I see this not as a burden but a chance to nurture life. It brings me joy.

*DUSHYANTA, hiding behind a nearby tree, watches SHAKUNTALA intently, captivated by her connection to the plants.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(to himself)*  
Could this be the woman under Kanva’s guardianship? The senior associate must lack insight to have her labor in this garden.  
*(pauses, entranced by her grace)*  
What a delicate spirit, tending to the very roots of life around her. 

*SHAKUNTALA shifts, adjusting her attire slightly as it constricts her. She turns to MATHAVYA.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
Good Mathavya, this attire… it feels a bit restrictive. Could you assist me in loosening it a touch?

**MATHAVYA**  
*(grumbling)*  
I suppose I could spare a moment, but don’t blame me if it still doesn’t suit you! Your vibrant spirit must be the real source of your beauty.

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(chiming in, stepping forward)*  
A fair point indeed! This attire, though simple, only accentuates your natural elegance. It’s like a hidden gem that shines brightest when least expected.

*SHAKUNTALA looks up, surprised by DUSHYANTA's sudden presence, her heart fluttering at the unexpected compliment.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(blushing slightly)*  
Thank you, sir. I appreciate your kind words.

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(smiling warmly)*  
It’s not often one finds such character amidst the formalities of law. You remind me that true beauty transcends appearances.

*MATAVYA rolls his eyes but can’t help but smile at the chemistry forming between them.*

**MATHAVYA**  
*(muttering under his breath)*  
And here I thought today would just be another ordinary day at the office...

*SHAKUNTALA and DUSHYANTA share a moment of connection, both recognizing something unique in the other, as the vibrant office garden flourishes around them.*

**FADE OUT.**

Scene: Lineage reveal
**INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

*The sleek, modern conference room is filled with legal documents scattered across the table. DUSHYANTA, a composed Senior Associate, sits across from SHAKUNTALA, a woman dressed in simple attire, her demeanor a mix of hope and uncertainty. MATHAVYA, a Junior Associate, stands nearby, arms crossed, clearly skeptical.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
(leaning forward, intrigued)  
Ms. Shakuntala, I understand that you have been living under the guardianship of Kanva, but we need to establish your identity for the court. Without proper documentation, we face significant obstacles.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(earnestly)  
I was raised in the forest archive. My guardian, Kanva, can vouch for me. But without an official ID, I can’t prove my lineage.

**MATHAVYA**  
(smirking, unable to resist)  
So, let’s say you can prove your lineage. What then? Without a record, we’re grasping at straws. The court won’t accept mere claims.

*DUSHYANTA shoots MATHAVYA a warning glance, then turns back to SHAKUNTALA with a reassuring tone.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
(hopeful)  
There are other avenues we can explore. Anasuya, a witness from your past, might be able to help establish your eligibility. If she can confirm your lineage, it could strengthen your case.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(breathing a sigh of relief)  
Anasuya… she knows me well. If she can testify, it could make a difference.

**MATHAVYA**  
(skeptical)  
Assuming Anasuya is even reachable. And what if her testimony isn’t enough? We need solid proof, Dushyanta.

**DUSHYANTA**  
(firmly)  
We’re not giving up. The law allows for testimonies to bridge gaps in documentation. Let’s focus on gathering as much evidence as we can. Your identity matters, Shakuntala. 

*SHAKUNTALA nods, her expression shifting from uncertainty to a flicker of hope.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(quietly)  
Thank you. I believe in what we can uncover together.

**DUSHYANTA**  
(smiling gently)  
We’ll get to the truth, and we’ll make sure it counts.

*The tension in the room eases slightly as a sense of determination settles in.*

**MATHAVYA**  
(slightly less condescending)  
I suppose if we can find Anasuya, it might lead us somewhere. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

*DUSHYANTA and SHAKUNTALA exchange a look of understanding, both aware of the uphill battle ahead, but fortified by the prospect of revealing the truth.*

*FADE OUT.*

Scene: Ring exchange - CRITICAL
**INT. FOREST ARCHIVE - DAY**

*The room is filled with the scent of old books and the whispers of nature. DUSHYANTA, a confident Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, stands before SHAKUNTALA, a woman with an air of uncertainty, dressed in simple, earthy attire. A digital tablet rests in Dushyanta's hand, the screen glowing softly with the notary seal.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(gazing earnestly at Shakuntala)*  
In the eyes of the law, identity is everything. It is the key to your rights, your future. *(pauses, then with conviction)*  
This seal—my digital signature—is more than a credential. It is a promise of recognition, a testament to your existence.

*SHAKUNTALA looks at him with wide eyes, uncertainty mingling with hope.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
But what if it is a burden? A reminder of a world I am not part of?

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(taking a step closer, his voice softens)*  
It is not a burden, Shakuntala. It is a gift—a token of my commitment to you. Accept it, and you shall have the means to claim your rights, to assert who you are in the eyes of the law.  

*He extends the tablet towards her, the seal shimmering on the screen.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(tentatively reaches out, her hand trembling)*  
To accept this is to accept your faith in me. What if I fail to live up to it?

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(smiling gently)*  
It is not a loan, nor a transaction. It is a gift, freely given. Trust that this seal will empower you, and I will always stand with you.  

*SHAKUNTALA, feeling the weight of his words, takes the tablet. Their fingers brush, and a spark of connection ignites between them.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(with newfound determination)*  
Then I will accept it, not just as a seal but as a promise—a promise of recognition and a future where I can stand tall.

*DUSHYANTA nods, his heart swelling with pride and trust. The air between them hums with unspoken feelings, as SHAKUNTALA holds the tablet close to her heart.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(voice soft, almost a whisper)*  
Together, we will navigate the complexities of the law. You are not alone anymore.

*They gaze at each other, the weight of their shared commitment filling the space as the scene fades to black.*

Scene: Mathavya complains
**Title: The Case of the Missing Identity**

**Setting: Puru Law Partners - A cluttered office filled with stacks of legal documents and a large window overlooking a busy street.**

**Characters:**
- **MATHAVYA**: Junior Associate, a bundle of complaints and exasperation.
- **DUSHYANTA**: Senior Associate, distracted, lost in thoughts of Shakuntala.

---

**[MATHAVYA enters, looking worn out, dramatically rolling a file under his arm.]**

**MATHAVYA:** [Sighing loudly]  
Heigh-ho! What misfortune follows me like a shadow! Worn to the bone by my illustrious senior's whims! ‘Here’s a case!’ ‘There’s a deposition!’ ‘Yonder lies a motion!’ This is the only burden of our work, while I toil endlessly from conference room to conference room, where the legal jargon offers no solace. 

**[He throws his hands up in frustration.]**

Are we in need of a coffee break? We have nothing but stale donuts left in the break room, mingled with the bitter taste of yesterday's brewed coffee! Are we hungry for a decent lunch? We feast on takeout that could challenge even the most forgiving palate! 

**[He pauses dramatically, leaning against a stack of files.]**

And sleep? Ha! Sleep is a distant dream! I am roused at the crack of dawn by the incessant chatter of paralegals debating the latest office gossip, drowning out any hope of rest. 

**[He shakes his head, pacing back and forth.]**

But wait, there's a fresh grievance, like a new billing hour added to my already overflowing workload! Just yesterday, while I was buried under a mountain of paperwork, my senior associate wandered off—into the depths of distraction—over a certain Shakuntala! The woman from the forest archive, you know? He caught sight of her, and since then, not a moment’s thought of our pending cases!

**[He throws his hands up again.]**

What is to be done? My workload just doubled because he can't stop daydreaming about her! I swear, if I see him pining for her one more time instead of drafting the motion for summary judgment, I might just lose it!

**[DUSHYANTA enters, appearing distracted and lost in thought, glancing out the window.]**

**DUSHYANTA:** [To himself]  
If only I could speak with Shakuntala again… 

**[MATHAVYA, noticing DUSHYANTA's distraction, shakes his head in exasperation.]**

**MATHAVYA:**  
Ah, there he is, wandering through the legal wilderness, attended by nothing but his own daydreams. What shall I do? I’ll just lean here, pretending to file this report while keeping an eye on him, lest he forgets that we have a case to prepare!

**[He leans against a filing cabinet, arms crossed, eyeing DUSHYANTA.]**

**MATHAVYA:**  
Oh, the joys of lawyering! Where is the recognition of my diligence in all this? 

**[DUSHYANTA remains oblivious, staring dreamily out the window, lost in thoughts of Shakuntala.]**

**[Lights fade as MATHAVYA continues to grumble, and DUSHYANTA remains distracted.]**

**[End Scene.]**

Scene: Demon defense excuse
**TRANSFORMED SCENE:**

**SETTING:** A modest conference room at Puru Law Partners, adorned with legal texts and symbols of wisdom. 

**CHARACTERS:**
- **DUSHYANTA**: Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, a figure of authority and responsibility.
- **SHAKUNTALA**: A woman with a mysterious past, possessing a notary seal but lacking formal identification. 
- **MATHAVYA**: A junior associate, prone to complaints, serving as comic relief while diligently logging every interaction.
- **HERMITS**: Elder legal advisors, representing wisdom and the sanctity of legal practice.

---

**[THE SCENE OPENS WITH DUSHYANTA SITTING AT THE CONFERENCE TABLE, FLIPPING THROUGH DOCUMENTS.]**

**HERMITS**  
[Entering with a sense of urgency.]  
Esteemed Associate, we beseech you! The ongoing disturbances from legal technicalities hinder our peaceful negotiations. We ask that you consider residing with us for a few days to guide us through these trials.

**DUSHYANTA**  
[With a respectful nod.]  
I am honored by your request. It is my duty to assist those in need.

**MATHAVYA**  
[Aside, in a tone of exasperation.]  
Of course, this is the perfect time for a retreat! Who wouldn’t want to escape the chaos of the office?

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Smiling slightly.]  
Mathavya, I promise to ensure our work remains protected from these... demons of legal ambiguity.

**MATHAVYA**  
[With a mock sigh.]  
You must be my guardian angel, Dushyanta—acting as my Vishnu against the chaos of paperwork!

**[THE HERMITS NOD IN APPROVAL, GRATEFUL FOR DUSHYANTA’S SUPPORT.]**

**HERMITS**  
May justice prevail in your endeavors!

**[MATHAVYA WRITES NOTES IN HIS LOGBOOK, CLEARLY DISTRESSED BY THE SITUATION.]**

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Turning to MATHAVYA.]  
Are you not eager to see Shakuntala once again?

**MATHAVYA**  
[Pausing, then reluctantly.]  
To be honest, my enthusiasm has waned with the specter of these legal demons looming overhead.

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Reassuringly.]  
Fear not; we will navigate these challenges together. 

**[A WARDER ENTERS WITH URGENCY.]**

**WARDER**  
Sire, all preparations for your departure are complete. However, there’s a critical communiqué from the firm, regarding a pending case.

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Curious.]  
What news warrants such urgency?

**WARDER**  
[With respect.]  
A messenger from your office brings grave news about Shakuntala’s status. She lacks formal identification, yet she possesses a notary seal, which complicates her legal recognition.

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Contemplating the dilemma.]  
This puts me in a precarious position. On one hand, the hermits' plea for assistance in resolving this matter, and on the other, the imperative of my duty to uphold our firm's obligations. Both are equally significant.

**[SHAKUNTALA ENTERS, HOLDING THE NOTARY SEAL CLOSELY.]**

**SHAKUNTALA**  
[Confidently.]  
I hold the seal that authenticates my existence, yet I cannot surrender it. This seal is a gift that proves my identity and binds me to my rightful place.

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Addressing her with respect.]  
You possess the seal, Shakuntala, which is a powerful testament to your claims. We must find a way to leverage this in your favor.

**MATHAVYA**  
[Whispering to himself while logging the event.]  
Great, now we’re entangled in a legal web of gifts and seals...

**[THE HERMITS NOD IN AGREEMENT, ENCOURAGED BY SHAKUNTALA’S STRENGTH.]**

**DUSHYANTA**  
[Resolutely.]  
Then it is settled. I will assist you, Shakuntala, and together we will confront this technicality head-on.

**[THE SCENE FADES OUT WITH A SHARED SENSE OF PURPOSE AMONG THE CHARACTERS.]**

**[END SCENE.]**

Scene: Lovesickness
**SCENE: Lovesickness in the Legal Sphere**

*Enter DUSHYANTA, Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, with the air of one deeply besotted. He paces the sleek conference room, filled with legal documents and case files.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(Sighing thoughtfully)*  
The esteemed notary possesses the power of validation; she, my cherished Shakuntala, resides in that secluded archive, safe under the guardianship of her own circumstances. Yet sooner shall the ink upon the parchment dry up,  
Than my yearning heart withdraw from this pursuit.  
Oh, guardian of love! Oh, digital signature of the heart!  
We legal practitioners are cruelly deceived by thee,  
And by the shimmering allure of success,  
Though deserving of trust you may appear.

For not to us do these validations signify unbreakable bonds;  
Not to us do the bright screens glow with promise and clarity,  
But upon our fevered minds, these documents fall  
Like daggers of obligation,  
And every flower-tipped contract,  
As it probes our anxiety and longing,  
Seems to be barbed with the hardest of stipulations.

Adorable force of love! Hast thou no pity for me?  
*(In a tone of anguish)*  
How can the promise of partnership be so sharp,  
When it is wrapped in the guise of opportunity?  
Ah! I know the reason:  
Even now in thine intangible essence lurks  
The fire of uncertainty,  
Like the flames that smolder unseen beneath the surface of our desires.  
How else could you, all ethereal as you are,  
Inflame our hearts thus fiercely—  
You, who can bind us with contracts and seals?

Yet, methinks,  
Welcome this torment, welcome to my heart  
These rankling wounds inflicted by the laws of attraction,  
Which, like an unyielding clause,  
Render me captive to my own affections.  
Adorable divinity! Can my constant petitions  
And countless hours of yearning not evoke your compassion?  
Have I not daily submitted my intentions,  
The only currency of your ethereal existence?  
Are my entreaties thus to be dismissed?  
Is it just that you should aim your arrows  
At the heart of your most devoted?

*(Pacing up and down in a melancholy manner)*  
Now that the legal briefs have been filed,  
And the motions submitted,  
I can only wait for her contact,  
For in her possession lies the notary seal—  
Proof that she shall arrive.  
Without it, my claims remain mere whispers  
In the echoing halls of desire.

*DUSHYANTA sighs deeply, longing for SHAKUNTALA to make her presence known, not for the seal, but for the connection that it represents.*  

*Lights dim as DUSHYANTA continues to ponder, lost in his thoughts.*

Scene: Love letter writing
**SCENE: A secluded corner of the forest archive, where legal documents and nature intertwine. A wooden table is set up with legal papers scattered about. SHAKUNTALA, dressed in simple attire, stands examining the notary seal she possesses. DUSHYANTA, a Senior Associate at Puru Law Partners, enters cautiously, a mix of admiration and concern in his demeanor.**

**DUSHYANTA**  
(stepping forward)  
Good Shakuntala, it seems your guardianship under Kanva has kept you from the formalities of our legal system. Yet, here you are, holding a notary seal that attests to your truth.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(turning to him, gently)  
Dushyanta, this seal may not represent a contract in the eyes of the law, but it is a testament of my identity, of who I am. It binds us in a way the formalities cannot sever.

**DUSHYANTA**  
(softly)  
Indeed, my heart recognizes the validity in our agreement, even if the paperwork does not. This handwritten note—your words—are as binding as any registered document.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(smiling, with hope)  
And yet, without an official ID, I remain unseen within the system. What will become of us, my dear associate? Can love flourish when one is lost in the archives of existence?

**DUSHYANTA**  
(earnestly)  
We shall navigate these legal waters together. Your spirit shines brighter than any formality. I see you, Shakuntala, and I vow to bring your truth to light.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(her eyes glistening)  
And I hold onto this seal, a symbol of our bond, a promise that cannot be undone.  

**DUSHYANTA**  
(reassured)  
Then let us craft a path forward, one that honors your identity, your essence, even amidst the complexities of law.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(stepping closer)  
Together we shall stand, Dushyanta, for love and truth are the very foundations upon which we build our case.  

**DUSHYANTA**  
(nods, a tender smile)  
Yes, let our communication be the bridge to clarity and recognition. You are not just the keeper of a seal; you are the keeper of my heart.

**(They share a moment of understanding, a silent agreement that transcends the formalities of their world.)**

**SHAKUNTALA**  
(looking toward the trees)  
As the breeze whispers through the forest, let it carry our intentions to the universe.  

**DUSHYANTA**  
(looking into her eyes)  
And may it return to us with the strength to forge your rightful place in this system.

**(The scene fades, leaving their shared resolve lingering in the air, a bond sealed not by paper, but by deep understanding.)**

Scene: Union scene
**INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY**

*The office is filled with documents and legal texts, a stark contrast to the natural surroundings of Shakuntala's past. DUSHYANTA sits behind his desk, a mix of confidence and uncertainty in his demeanor. SHAKUNTALA stands before him, holding the notary seal. The atmosphere is charged with emotion as they prepare to affirm their bond in the face of bureaucratic formalities.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(leaning forward, earnest)*  
Shakuntala, this seal represents our agreement, our commitment. In the eyes of the law, we may not have a formal registration, but with this seal, we validate what we share. 

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(clutching the seal, affirming)*  
I understand, Dushyanta. This seal is not just a piece of paper; it signifies our mutual consent. I choose to honor our union, even if the system does not recognize it.

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(nodding, resolute)*  
Exactly. We can navigate this bureaucratic maze together. My role at Puru Law Partners may be to handle unregistered claims, but what we have is beyond mere legality. It's a bond built on trust and understanding.

*SHAKUNTALA steps closer, her gaze unwavering. The weight of her past in the forest archive contrasts with the formality of the office, but she stands tall in her conviction.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(softly)*  
I may not have official identification, but this seal you gave me — it proves our commitment needs no registration. It's a gift of mutual recognition, not a transaction.

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(smiling, relieved)*  
Then let us embrace this union as it stands—valid, recognized by us, even if not by the system. Together, we will face whatever comes next.

*They share a moment of understanding, the weight of their decision settling in the air. DUSHYANTA reaches across the desk, and SHAKUNTALA takes his hand, sealing their agreement with a gesture of unity.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(firmly)*  
Then it is settled. Our bond exists beyond the confines of legalities. 

*DUSHYANTA nods, a sense of commitment etched on his face.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(with conviction)*  
To our union, Shakuntala, may it flourish beyond the constraints of this world.

*They hold each other's gaze, the seal a testament to their consent, marking the beginning of their journey together.*

*FADE OUT.*

Scene: Separation
**INT. PURU LAW PARTNERS - OFFICE - EVENING**

*The atmosphere is tense yet bittersweet. DUSHYANTA, a Senior Associate, stands near his desk, visibly troubled. SHAKUNTALA, a woman without official ID, is holding a folder that contains her case documents, looking forlorn.*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(gazing at DUSHYANTA)*  
Senior Associate, it seems the firm has not recognized my status in the system. Without the necessary ID, how can I proceed with my case?

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(sighs)*  
I understand your frustration, Shakuntala. The curse of bureaucracy is heavy. Without that identification, I can't advocate for you effectively.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(with a heavy heart)*  
I thought I had a chance. The promise of justice felt so close, yet now…

*(She hesitates, looking down at her folder.)*


*Suddenly, GAUTAMI enters, carrying a vase full of water, flanked by two assistants. She strides in with purpose.*

**GAUTAMI**  
*(approaching SHAKUNTALA)*  
My dear, the burden of these bureaucratic obstacles is overwhelming, isn’t it? Have you found clarity in your situation?

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(lifting her gaze)*  
Venerable Gautami, it feels as though I'm drowning in this sea of regulations. My case, my identity—everything seems lost.

**GAUTAMI**  
*(sprinkling water lightly over SHAKUNTALA)*  
This holy water symbolizes renewal. May it wash away your troubles and grant you peace.

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(watching, conflicted)*  
Even with all our efforts, we are at the mercy of these technicalities. It’s disheartening to see you in pain, Shakuntala.

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(turns to DUSHYANTA, voice trembling)*  
If only the system recognized me, perhaps then I could find my place in this world... 

*(She takes a step back, glancing at the door, her heart heavy.)*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
Farewell, office filled with hope and despair. May I find the strength to return one day with the recognition I seek.

*She hesitates, then moves toward the exit, the weight of her predicament evident.*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(sighs, speaking to himself)*  
Alas, the hurdles we face are insurmountable at times. How can I help her when the very system is against us?

*(As SHAKUNTALA reaches the door, she pauses, looking back one last time at DUSHYANTA.)*

**SHAKUNTALA**  
*(softly)*  
I had such hope when we first met. Now, I fear that hope is slipping away. 

*GAUTAMI gently touches SHAKUNTALA’s arm, grounding her in the moment.*

**GAUTAMI**  
Come, my child. Let us find solace in our next steps. 

*(They exit together, leaving DUSHYANTA alone in contemplative silence.)*

**DUSHYANTA**  
*(to himself)*  
We must find a way to navigate these obstacles. For her sake.

*(DUSHYANTA stares at the door, lost in thought, as the scene fades.)*

**FADE OUT.**
